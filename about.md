title: About Francesca Bottenghi
---

I am a dedicated **Journalist** with 7 years of experience creating original and engaging content for leading media groups, including *Cond√© Nast* and *Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso*.

I have always been passionate about storytelling, and since I started working as a reporter I have had the opportunity to write about a wide range of topics, from photography to design, from fashion to technology, from ecology to charity. I have also been effective in editing and proofreading texts for both print and online distribution.

In addition to my media knowledge, I can offer exemplary organization and time management skills, as well as the ability to work in high-functioning team environments and to communicate with diverse audiences.
